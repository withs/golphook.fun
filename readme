golphook.fun alpha
==================

    golphook is my attempt to make a csgo internal written in c++ with basic features and nuklear implementation for the ui, 
    this was made for fun and to use by me after i moved on windows 7 and rbh and skeet wasn't working on it ^^ so i thought making my own was a good idea
    and it was cool and i learned some cool things. I dont recommend to use it i make it public because i stopped used it.
    The site associated with it is troll site for me and some friends.
